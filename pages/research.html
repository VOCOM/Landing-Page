  <h2>Bachelor Thesis: Vision Language Action for Restaurant Inventory Management</h2>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    This project explores the application of a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, to generate robot trajectories for
    food preparation and handling tasks. We propose an approach that leverages VLA's multimodal capabilities to
    integrate visual and linguistic inputs, enabling robots to understand and execute sorting instructions.
